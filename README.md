# Flappy Bird Clone – Android (Kotlin)

A simple, fun, and lightweight Flappy Bird clone built using Kotlin in Android Studio.
This project demonstrates basic game mechanics such as canvas drawing, object movement, touch input, collision detection, animations, and score tracking.

## Features

Tap-to-fly gameplay
  - The bird ascends when the screen is tapped and falls due to gravity.

Smooth animations
The bird, pipes, and background are animated using the Canvas API and game loop.

Pipe obstacles
  - Randomly generated pipes with gaps that the player must navigate through.

Collision detection
  - Game over triggers when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

Score tracking
  - Score increments each time the player passes through pipes.

Auto-restart
  - Easy game restart after losing.

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin – core game logic
- Android Studio – IDE
- Canvas API – drawing objects on screen
- SurfaceView/Game Loop – animation and movement
- Timers / Handlers – controlling object updates
- XML Layouts – UI setup (start screen, buttons, etc.)
